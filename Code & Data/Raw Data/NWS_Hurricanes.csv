The lowest pressure reading also occurred at Southeast Texas Regional Airport, with a low of 982.4 mb.||No tornadoes were reported in southeast Texas.||Storm surge was a significant event. Sabine Pass had its highest water level recorded during Ike, with a maximum of 14.24 ft MLLW. This storm surge almost topped the seawall around Port Arthur, but large waves did crash over the seawall, causing some flooding of homes within 3 blocks of the seawall. In Orange County, Bridge City had nearly all of their homes flooded (over 3000), and this extended north to Rose City, and northeast to the city of Orange, where water topped the levee on the east side of town. Over 3000 homes were also flooded in Orange.||Maximum storm total rainfall was between 5 and 8 inches across Jefferson, Hardin, Orange, and southern Jasper counties.||Only one fatality occurred during Ike. A 40 year old man was trying to drive back to his home in Port Neches. His truck was swept off Highway 73 near Rainbow Bridge by the large storm surge and waves.||Total damages, however, were high. Loses are estimated to be at least 1.3 billion dollars across southeast Texas.",66,48180

As Hurricane Omar moved through the region, high winds, torrential rainfall, and pounding surf all affected the islands.  Localized flooding was observed across some low-lying areas and wind damage occurred across parts of St. Croix, nearest to the center of circulation.  Additionally, antecedent rains, prior to the passage of the hurricane, caused many low-lying roads to be submerged, which further exacerbated the flooding conditions. In constructing a time line of the event, tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were first issued for the USVI on Tuesday, October 14, 2008 at 5:00 PM LST at the time when Omar became a tropical storm.  By 11:00 PM LST that same evening, Omar strengthened to hurricane status, and thus, hurricane warnings replaced the tropical storm warnings at that time.  It wasn���t until Thursday, October 16, 2008 at 5:00 AM LST that all warnings were dropped for all of the USVI.||Hurricane Omar���s winds were estimated at 115 mph (with higher gusts) at the time of passage near the USVI.

The strongest effects of Hurricane Omar were first felt in St. Croix, as the storm moved from southwest to northeast across the northeastern Caribbean.  The eye of Omar, or the center of circulation, passed within several miles from the island of St. Croix, placing the easternmost end of the island under the northwestern and western part of the eyewall for a few hours.  Based on preliminary information from NOAA NOS Limetree Bay sensor, located on the central south side of the island, there was a period of 48 minutes, between 11:18 PM LST on Wednesday, October 15, 2008 through 12:06 AM LST on Thursday, October 16, 2008, where sustained winds greater than 49 mph were measured.

The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.

A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.

There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",94,22046

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.

The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.

The strengthening was such that on the evening of November 3 the National Weather Service Office in Guam started issuing Special Weather Statements on it. At that time it was still a tropical disturbance and was located near 6N156E or 95 miles west of Pohnpei. Further intensification resulted in the disturbance reaching tropical depression strength. On the night of November 3rd the first advisory was issued for Tropical Depression 31W when it was located near 6N155E. Even though it was only a depression it was expected to quickly intensify. This expectation was borne out as the depression became a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 4th and a typhoon by the afternoon of the 5th.
