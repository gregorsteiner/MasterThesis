# Natural Disasters and Education

In my thesis I explore the link between natural disasters and education
outcomes. The Stanford Education Data Archive (Reardon et al. 2021)
provides summary statistics for standardized test scores by county,
year, grade and subject. Data on natural disasters is available at the
FEMA database and the **rfema** package (Turner 2022) provides easy
access.

Below you can see the number of cumulative disasters by county.

To compare, here is the map of average test scores by county. Visually,
there seems to be some correlation.
