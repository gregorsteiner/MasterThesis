## Idea

Exploit the 2021 heatwave on the North American west coast

## Sick leave data:

* [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.html):
  + Available monthly (refers to the week inlcuding the 12th of that month)
  + Includes state and county information, but county is often missing

## Commuting data: 
* [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACS%20commuting&g=0100000US%240500000&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S0802): Yearly survey about commuting habits

* [Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/): Only yearly as well

* Maybe fuel consumption could be an alternative? That is available monthly from the [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=401685), but only for PADD regions

## Crime Data:
* Data of all recorded incidents (> 5 Mill.) in a given year is available [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/series/128?start=0&SERIESQ=128&ARCHIVE=NACJD&PUBLISH_STATUS=PUBLISHED&sort=DATEUPDATED%20desc&rows=50) or [here](https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/downloads):
  + Includes the exact date
  + Includes state and county numbers
  + But 2021 is not yet available.
