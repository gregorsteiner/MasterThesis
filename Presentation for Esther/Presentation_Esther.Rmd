## Data

* Commuting data: 
  + Detailed commuting data is available in the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACS%20commuting&g=0100000US%240500000&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S0802), but only yearly and only up to 2019
  + Maybe fuel consumption could be an alternative? That is available monthly from the [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=401685), but only for PADD regions
