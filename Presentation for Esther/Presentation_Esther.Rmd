## Idea

Exploit the 2021 heatwave on the North American west coast


```{r out.width="250px", fig.cap="Temperature Anomalies in June/July 2021"}
knitr::include_graphics("TempAnomMap.png")
```





## Data for outcome


* Sick leave data:
  + Monthly data from the [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.html), but county is often missing

* Commuting data: 
  + [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACS%20commuting&g=0100000US%240500000&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S0802) or [Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD)](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/), but only yearly
  + Maybe fuel consumption could be an alternative? That is available monthly from the [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=401685), but only for PADD regions

* Crime Data:
  + Data of all recorded incidents (> 5 Mill.) in a given year is available [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/series/128?start=0&SERIESQ=128&ARCHIVE=NACJD&PUBLISH_STATUS=PUBLISHED&sort=DATEUPDATED%20desc&rows=50) or [here](https://crime-data-explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/downloads). This includes the exact date and state and county numbers, but 2021 is not yet available.
