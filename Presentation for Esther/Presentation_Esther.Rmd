## Idea

Exploit the 2021 heatwave on the North American west coast


```{r out.width="250px", fig.cap="Temperature Anomalies in June/July 2021"}
knitr::include_graphics("TempAnomMap.png")
```





## Data for outcome

* Commuting data: 
  + Detailed commuting data is available in the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=ACS%20commuting&g=0100000US%240500000&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S0802), but only yearly and only up to 2019
  + Maybe fuel consumption could be an alternative? That is available monthly from the [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=401685), but only for PADD regions

* Sick leave data:
  + Available by county and month from the [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.html), but county is often missing
  + Easy access with the R package [**cpsR**](https://github.com/matt-saenz/cpsR)
  
* Crime Data:
  + Data of all recorded incidents (> 5 Mill.) in a given year is available [here](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/series/128?start=0&SERIESQ=128&ARCHIVE=NACJD&PUBLISH_STATUS=PUBLISHED&sort=DATEUPDATED%20desc&rows=50). This includes the exact date und state and county numbers. But most recent year is 2016.
  + More recent statistics are available for some major cities (e.g. New York, Portland)
