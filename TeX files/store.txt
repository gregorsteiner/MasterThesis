School closures often occur in the wake of natural disasters. These can have a substantial negative impact on academic success. For example, \cite{Grewening_2020} find that school closures as a measure against Covid 19 reduced students' learning time by about half.

\subsection{Control Variables}

Here, we discuss additional control variables, that is the content of $X_{i,t}$ in equations (\ref{baseline}) and (\ref{baselineBinned}). 

One may be tempted to include economic outcomes of a county, like income or unemployment, to control for different economic conditions. However, this is likely not a good idea. Let $Z$ be some measure of the economic conditions in a county, then $Z$ is likely influenced by both natural disasters and the average academic achievement in the county. Figure \ref{DAG} illustrates this relationship. $Z$ is referred to as a collider (or common effect), and conditioning on $Z$ induces a non-causal association between natural disasters and academic achievement \citep{Cinelli_2020}. In such cases, $Z$ is also called a bad control. Consequently, we do not include any economic control variables, that may be affected by both academic achievement and natural disasters.
