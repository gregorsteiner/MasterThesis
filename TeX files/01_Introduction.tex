\section{Introduction}


This article contributes to a rich literature on economic effects of natural disasters. Many authors have focused on one specific type of natural disasters, e.g. hurricanes \citep{Deryugina_2017, Deryugina_2018}. 

More specifically, this paper contributes to the literature on the impact of natural disasters on education. Some authors have investigated the link between natural disasters and human capital formation from a growth theory perspective \citep{Skidmore_2002, Cuaresma_2010}. Again, many authors focus on one particular type of disaster, e.g. heat \citep{Park_2020}.
