\section{Introduction}

Natural disasters are responsible for massive economic damage and due to climate change the frequency of such disasters will increase in most regions \citep{IPCC_2021}. Therefore, it is essential to have a good understanding of the consequences. While much research has been done on the macroeconomic consequences of natural disasters, few studies have focused on the impact on education. This study investigates the effect of natural disasters on academic performance.

A causal effect of natural disasters may be driven by school closures \citep{Grewening_2020} or lowered attendance \citep{Spencer_2016}, destroyed infrastructure, and emotional stress \citep{Vogel_2016}. Furthermore, some forms of disasters, e.g. extreme heat, may directly impair cognitive performance \citep{Ramsey_1995}.

To identify dynamic causal effects of experiencing natural disasters, this paper uses an event-study design. In particular, we estimate dynamic treatment effects for up to eight years after initial treatment. As a result, not only short-term but also medium to long-term effects can be found. Since treatment effects are likely very heterogenous, we use the estimator by \cite{Sun_2021}. 

This article uses standardized test data on a US county level for grades 3 through 8 in mathematics and reading language arts (RLA) to measure academic performance, covering the school years 2008/2009 to 2018/2019. This measure is very attractive as the test scores are standardized relative to a national reference cohort. Therefore, the outcomes are nationally comparable. For the same period, we obtain data on natural disasters from declarations by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and data on storms from the National Weather Service.

We find strong evidence of a negative effect of disasters on mathematics performance in the same school year. Evidence of a significant effect on RLA, as well as for medium and long term effects is rather weak.

\textbf{Previous Work}: This article contributes to a rich literature on the economic effects of natural disasters. More specifically, this paper contributes to the literature on the impact of natural disasters on education. Previous work has produced mixed results. Some authors find significant effects of natural disasters on the education system, while others find no or only small effects.

\cite{Holmes_2002} was among the first to study the effect of extreme weather events on academic achievement. Using a difference-in-differences approach, he finds a significantly negative effect on the performance of North Carolina students. \cite{Baggerly_2008} find a statistically significant, but negligibly small effect of the 2004 hurricanes on the performance of students' test scores in Florida. \cite{Lamb_2013} study the effects of hurricane Katrina and find a significant impact on mathematics achievement in Mississippi with the greatest effects in nonpoor and nonrural schools. \cite{Goodman_2020} find that cumulative heat exposure negatively impacts PSAT scores. At the same time, they find air conditioning to be very successful at mitigating the negative effect of heat exposure.

Many authors have focused on the role of student mobility as a consequence of natural disasters. \cite{Pane_2008} focus on students who switch schools following hurricanes Katrina and Rita and find small negative effects of displacement on test scores. Similarly, \cite{Sacerdote_2012} finds sharp declines in test scores one year after the hurricanes, but a substantial improvement three to four years after. This is largely driven by the students' tendency to switch to higher quality schools.
