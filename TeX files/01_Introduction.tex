\section{Introduction}

This article contributes to a rich literature on economic effects of natural disasters. Many authors have focused on one specific type of natural disasters, e.g. hurricanes \citep{Deryugina_2017, Deryugina_2018}. 

More specifically, this paper contributes to the literature on the impact of natural disasters on education. Some authors have investigated the link between natural disasters and human capital formation from a growth theory perspective, e.g. \cite{Cuaresma_2010} finds a strong negative effect of geologic natural disaster risk on secondary school enrolment rates. 

There is extensive evidence for a negative effect of heat exposure on learning \cite[e.g.][]{Goodman_2020, Park_2020}.
